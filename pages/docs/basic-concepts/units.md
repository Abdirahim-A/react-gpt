# Define a Unit

## Understanding units

Units can be simple, like in `4 apples`.

Yet, sometimes you need to express units in regards to another unit.

For example, miles per hour is a speed expressing the number of miles travelled in exactly one hour.

```deci live
40 miles/hour
==> 40 miles per hour
```

Decipad will simplify units for you when possible:

```deci live
Speed = 40 miles/hour
Distance = Speed * 4 hours
==> 160 miles
```

> Note: in the example above we're using variables to hold values.
> To declare a variable and assign it a value you can type `variable_name = value`.

The same goes for division:

```deci live
Distance = 40 miles
Duration = 2 hours
Speed = Distance / Duration
==> 20 miles per hour
```

## Converting between units

### Simple units

Decipad understands some basic units. To convert between them you can use the `in` directive like this:

```deci live
3 kmeters in miles
==> 1.8(641135767120019088523025530899546647578143) miles
```

```deci live
2 atm in Pa
==> 202650 Pa
```

Since Decipad understands unit multipliers (`deca` `mili`, `centi`, `h`, `k`), you can use them as unit prefixes:

```deci live
1 decimetre in centimetre
==> 10 centimetres
```

### Complex units

You can also convert more complex units. For instance, you may have the number of bananas per unit of area, and you wish to convert to the number of bananas per another unit of area:

```deci live
10 bananas/meter^2 in bananas/yard^2
==> 8.3612 bananas·yard⁻²
```

Or, with more known units:

```deci live
4184 joules/hour in calories/day
==> 24000 calories per day
```

### Expanding and contracting units

Decipad can contract and expand units automatically. For instance, pressure is force divided by area. So Decipad understands this and tries to do the right thing when you mix these units in conversions:

```deci live
30 newtons/m2 in bars
==> 0.0003 bars
```

```deci live
30 bars in newton/m2
==> 3000000 N/m²
```

Or in operations:

```deci live
3 bar + 13 newton/inch^2
==> 206.548 N·inch⁻²
```

Decipad will even auto-convert units when you need the same units for some non-numeric operations:

```deci live
cat([1 meters, 2], [3 centimeters, 4])
==> [ 1 meters, 2 meters, 0.03 meters, 0.04 meters ]
```

### Conversion factors

In Decipad the following

```deci live
Bolt = 44.72 kmeter/hour in meter/sec
==> 12.4(2) meters per sec
```

is the same as

```deci live
Speed = 44.72
HoursToSec = 3600
SpeedInSeconds = Speed / HoursToSec
KmToMeters = 1000
SpeedInMetersSecond = SpeedInSeconds * KmToMeters
==> 12.4(2)
```

### Creating your own units

We don't support all units. However, you can create your own:

```deci live
SpeedOfSound = 1234.8 km/h
Bolt = 44.72 km/hour
ceil(SpeedOfSound in Bolt)
==> 28 Bolts
```

### Proportions

Simplified units can end up as a proportion, for example:

```deci live
45 sec/minute
==> 0.75
```

You can even use the unit simplifier for numbers.

School children are often asked how many tens, or how many ones in a number:

```deci live
Number = 23
HowManyTens = round(Number in 10)
==> 2
```

```deci live
Number = 23
HowManyTens = round(Number in 10)
HowManyOnes = Number mod 10
==> 3
```

## Custom conversions

An interesting aspect of how units work in Deci is that you can define your units and customize conversions according to your needs.

For instance, in Decipad a cup is equivalent to 0.25 litres, which is the standard UK metric:

```deci live
1 cup in L
==> 0.25 L
```

But different countries can have different cup sizes, so you can define a custom unit to use in conversions as you wish:

```deci live
Flour = 0.75 L
MyCup = 0.2 L
Flour in MyCup
==> 3.75 MyCups
```

This also means that you can create your custom units:

```deci live
Sugar = 1 cup
Glass = 0.33 L
Sugar in Glass
==> 0.(75) Glasses
```

## Unit Relations

Besides a quantity, units can also have a quality.

For instance, `1 kilogram of flour` and `30 grams of sugar` are both represented by units of mass with different qualities `flour` and `sugar`.

You can define **Qualities** with the keyword `of`.

An example will make things easier to grasp:

```deci live
flour = 2 kg of flour
butter = 150 g of butter

ratio = butter / flour
==> 75 g of butter/kg of flour
```

With qualities, you are able to express data relations in a more realistic way. On our example you can clearly see that for every `kg of flour`you will have `75 g of butter`. Awesome right?

Here's another example:

```deci live
constructionIndex = 1.6 meters^2 of usefularea / meters^2 of land
terrain = 600 meters^2 of land

buildingArea = constructionIndex * terrain
==> 960 meters² of usefularea
```
